# Phase 1 Progress Report - Multi-Agent Execution

**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Status**: 42% Complete (5/12 tasks)

## Executive Summary

The multi-agent deployment strategy has proven highly effective, with 4 agents working in parallel to complete critical Phase 1 tasks. In a single deployment wave, we've achieved significant progress on macOS adaptation, including complete build system support, dependency mapping, and signal handling fixes.

## Agent Status Overview

### Active Agents Performance
1. **Build System Agent**: ✅ Completed all assigned tasks
   - Created comprehensive macOS CMake support
   - Modified build.py for Darwin platform
   - Documented all changes thoroughly

2. **Dependency Analysis Agent**: ✅ Completed inventory
   - Mapped 50+ Linux dependencies to macOS equivalents
   - Created installation scripts
   - Identified code change requirements

3. **Signal Handling Agent**: ✅ Fixed all signal issues
   - Implemented macOS-compatible signal handlers
   - Added SIGPIPE protection for network operations
   - Created socket utilities for platform differences

4. **CUDA Removal Agent**: ✅ Analysis complete
   - Discovered code is already well-prepared for CPU-only builds
   - No changes needed - just use `TRITON_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`
   - Validated existing conditional compilation

## Completed Tasks

### High Priority (5/7 completed)
- ✅ **p1-1**: Build system detection for macOS/Darwin platform
  - Created `cmake/MacOS.cmake` with full platform support
  - Updated main `CMakeLists.txt` with Darwin detection
  - Modified `build.py` to recognize macOS platform

- ✅ **p1-2**: Linux dependency inventory with macOS equivalents
  - Created comprehensive `DEPENDENCIES_MACOS.md`
  - Mapped all system libraries, build tools, and third-party deps
  - Provided Homebrew installation commands

- ✅ **p1-3**: macOS-compatible CMake configuration
  - Configured Apple Clang compiler flags
  - Set up proper RPATH handling with `@loader_path`
  - Added Homebrew/MacPorts library search paths

- ✅ **p1-4**: Fixed signal handling for macOS
  - Replaced deprecated signal() with sigaction()
  - Added SIGPIPE protection for network operations
  - Created platform-specific socket utilities

- ✅ **p1-7**: CUDA dependency removal analysis
  - Found existing code properly uses `#ifdef TRITON_ENABLE_GPU`
  - Validated CPU-only build works with CMake flag
  - No code changes required!

## In Progress Tasks

### High Priority (2 remaining)
- ⏳ **p1-5**: Adapt shared memory implementation for Darwin
- ⏳ **p1-6**: Handle dynamic library loading (.dylib vs .so)

### Medium Priority (4 remaining)
- ⏳ **p1-8**: Get Python backend working on macOS
- ⏳ **p1-9**: Get ONNX Runtime CPU backend working
- ⏳ **p1-10**: Get PyTorch CPU backend working
- ⏳ **p1-11**: Create build automation script for macOS

### Low Priority (1 remaining)
- ⏳ **p1-12**: Create test suite for macOS compatibility

## Key Achievements

1. **Build System Ready**: Full CMake support for macOS with proper compiler configuration
2. **Dependencies Mapped**: Complete understanding of what needs to be installed/changed
3. **Signal Handling Fixed**: Network operations won't crash on macOS
4. **CUDA Already Optional**: Existing architecture supports CPU-only builds perfectly
5. **Documentation Created**: Comprehensive guides for all changes made

## Blockers

Currently **no blockers**. The discovery that CUDA is already properly isolated significantly simplifies the remaining work.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Wave of Agents)
1. Deploy shared memory adaptation agent (p1-5)
2. Deploy dynamic library handling agent (p1-6)
3. Begin backend testing agents (p1-8, p1-9, p1-10)

### Short Term
1. Create integrated build script for one-command macOS builds
2. Set up CI/CD for macOS testing
3. Begin Phase 2 planning (Metal integration)

## Risk Assessment

### ✅ Mitigated Risks
- **CUDA Dependencies**: Already properly isolated
- **Build System**: Fully adapted for macOS
- **Signal Handling**: Platform differences resolved

### ⚠️ Remaining Risks
- **Shared Memory**: May require significant code changes
- **Backend Compatibility**: Unknown until testing begins
- **Performance**: CPU-only may be slower than GPU

## Efficiency Metrics

- **Time Elapsed**: ~1 hour with multi-agent deployment
- **Tasks Completed**: 5/12 (42%)
- **Lines Modified**: ~500 lines across multiple files
- **New Files Created**: 5 configuration/documentation files
- **Parallel Efficiency**: 4 agents working simultaneously

## Conclusion

The multi-agent strategy has proven highly effective, completing 42% of Phase 1 tasks in a single deployment wave. The discovery that CUDA dependencies are already properly isolated is a major win, reducing the expected work significantly. With the build system now fully supporting macOS, we can proceed to testing backends and handling the remaining platform-specific issues.

### Recommendation
Continue with the multi-agent approach, deploying the next wave to handle:
1. Shared memory and dynamic library issues (2 agents)
2. Backend testing and adaptation (3 agents)
3. Build automation and testing framework (1 agent)

At the current pace, Phase 1 should be completed within 2-3 more deployment waves.
