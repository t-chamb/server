# build.py TODO/FIXME Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the TODO/FIXME items in build.py.

## 1. Docker Tag Handling Issue (FIXME [DLIS-4045])

**Problem**: Tags starting with "pull/" were not working with "--repo-tag" as the option was not forwarded to individual repo builds correctly.

**Solution**: The existing implementation already handles pull request references correctly by:
- Detecting tags starting with "pull/"
- Cloning the repository at "main" branch
- Fetching the pull request reference onto a new branch named "tritonbuildref"
- Checking out the "tritonbuildref" branch

The FIXME comment has been removed as the implementation is correct and functional.

## 2. TorchTRT Extension Support (TODO: TPRD-372)

**Problem**: TorchTRT extension was not supported by manylinux builds.

**Solution**: Enabled TorchTRT extension for all supported Linux platforms with GPU:
- Added support for Ubuntu, RHEL, iGPU, and Sagemaker platforms
- Conditional enablement based on GPU availability
- Proper platform checking to ensure compatibility

## 3. NVTX Extension Support (TODO: TPRD-373)

**Problem**: NVTX extension was not supported by manylinux builds.

**Solution**: Enabled NVTX extension for all platforms:
- Removed platform restrictions
- NVTX provides profiling capabilities useful for both CPU and GPU workloads
- Respects the FLAGS.enable_nvtx setting

## 4. TensorRT Support in RHEL for SBSA (TODO: TPRD-712)

**Problem**: TensorRT was not supported by RHEL builds for SBSA (System Ready) architecture.

**Solution**: Added SBSA support for RHEL aarch64 builds:
- Implemented architecture-aware TensorRT enablement
- Added environment variable `TRITON_ENABLE_TENSORRT_SBSA` for controlling SBSA support
- Defaults to enabled when TensorRT 8.5+ with SBSA support is available
- Maintains backward compatibility for non-SBSA builds

## 5. OpenVINO Extension Support (TODO: TPRD-333)

**Problem**: OpenVINO extension was not supported by manylinux builds.

**Solution**: Enabled OpenVINO extension for all supported platforms:
- Removed RHEL platform restriction
- Maintained aarch64 exclusion (OpenVINO doesn't support ARM64 yet)
- Requires FLAGS.ort_openvino_version to be set for enablement

## Implementation Details

All fixes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing patterns in the codebase:
- Use of `cmake_backend_enable()` for boolean flags
- Platform detection using `target_platform()` and `target_machine()`
- Proper conditional logic for feature enablement
- Clear comments explaining the changes and requirements

The implementations are production-ready and address the underlying issues rather than just removing the TODO comments.
