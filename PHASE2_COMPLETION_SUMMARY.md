# Phase 2 Reorganization Complete - Scripts and Tools Organization

## Summary

Phase 2 of the reorganization has been successfully completed. All scripts have been organized into a logical directory structure while maintaining critical build files in the root directory for easy access.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Directory Structure
```
scripts/
├── build/          # Build and compilation scripts
├── apple-silicon/  # Apple Silicon specific scripts
├── testing/        # Testing scripts
├── utilities/      # Utility and helper scripts
└── deployment/     # (Reserved for future deployment scripts)
```

### 2. Moved Scripts to Appropriate Locations

#### Build Scripts (→ scripts/build/)
- build_macos.sh
- build_macos_patched.sh
- check_macos_env.sh
- cmake_compatibility_patch.sh
- cmake_wrapper.sh
- fix_cmake_build.sh
- fix_libevent_includes.sh
- fix_triton_build_final.sh
- prebuild_cmake_fix.sh

#### Apple Silicon Scripts (→ scripts/apple-silicon/)
- benchmark_apple_silicon.py
- benchmark_transformer.py
- convert_bert_to_coreml.py
- demo_apple_silicon.py
- generate_performance_charts.py
- monitor_apple_silicon.sh
- monitor_hardware.py
- qwen3_advanced_optimization.py
- run_apple_silicon_tests.sh
- run_qwen3_full.py
- run_transformer_demo.py
- setup_qwen3_apple_silicon.py
- setup_transformer_demo.sh
- test_apple_silicon_optimizations.sh
- test_transformer.py

#### Testing Scripts (→ scripts/testing/)
- test_macos_build.sh
- test_models_directly.py
- validate_environment.sh

#### Utility Scripts (→ scripts/utilities/)
- execute_safe_reorganization.sh
- execute_unified_solution.sh
- llm_inference_pipeline.py
- phase1_agent_deployment.py
- pipeline_client_example.py
- rollback_reorganization.sh
- verify_reorganization.sh

### 3. Preserved Critical Files in Root
- **build.py** - Main build script (essential entry point)
- **compose.py** - Docker compose utilities (essential entry point)
- **QUICK_START.sh** - Quick start guide (user-facing)

### 4. Created Documentation
- **scripts/README.md** - Detailed documentation of scripts directory structure
- **SCRIPT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference guide for commonly used scripts

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Backend Scripts Stay with Backends**: Scripts in backends/ directories (coreml, pytorch, metal_mps) remain with their code as they are tightly coupled.

2. **Essential Files in Root**: build.py, compose.py, and QUICK_START.sh remain in root for easy access and backward compatibility.

3. **Logical Grouping**: Scripts are grouped by function (build, testing, apple-silicon, utilities) for better discoverability.

4. **Permissions Preserved**: All executable permissions were maintained during the move.

## Verification

✅ All scripts moved successfully
✅ Executable permissions preserved
✅ No critical scripts missing
✅ Documentation created
✅ Git tracking shows files moved (not deleted/recreated)

## Ready for Phase 3

The scripts reorganization is complete and the project is ready for Phase 3: Documentation and Final Cleanup.

## Quick Access Examples

```bash
# Build Triton
./build.py

# Run Apple Silicon tests
./scripts/apple-silicon/run_apple_silicon_tests.sh

# Check environment
./scripts/testing/validate_environment.sh

# Build on macOS
./scripts/build/build_macos.sh
```
