# Intelligent Model Routing System

## Overview

The Intelligent Model Routing System provides automatic backend selection and load balancing for Triton Inference Server. It analyzes model characteristics, hardware capabilities, and runtime performance to make optimal routing decisions across CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backends.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Backend Selection**
- Analyzes model complexity, size, and structure
- Matches model requirements with backend capabilities
- Considers quantization support (INT8, FP16)
- Handles dynamic shapes and control flow

### 2. **Dynamic Performance Profiling**
- Learns from execution history
- Builds predictive models for latency, memory, and power
- Adapts routing decisions based on observed performance
- Maintains confidence scores for predictions

### 3. **Multiple Optimization Goals**
- **Minimize Latency**: For real-time applications
- **Maximize Throughput**: For batch processing
- **Minimize Power**: For edge deployments
- **Balanced**: Weighted combination of all factors

### 4. **Advanced Routing Policies**

#### Latency-Optimized Policy
```cpp
auto policy = std::make_shared<LatencyOptimizedPolicy>();
router.SetRoutingPolicy(policy);
```
- Selects backend with lowest predicted latency
- Considers current backend utilization
- Applies penalties for low-confidence predictions

#### Throughput-Optimized Policy
```cpp
auto policy = std::make_shared<ThroughputOptimizedPolicy>();
router.SetRoutingPolicy(policy);
```
- Maximizes compute utilization
- Prefers high-capacity backends (GPU, Neural Engine)
- Considers quantization acceleration

#### Power-Efficient Policy
```cpp
auto policy = std::make_shared<PowerEfficientPolicy>();
router.SetRoutingPolicy(policy);
```
- Optimizes performance per watt
- Prefers Neural Engine for supported models
- Suitable for battery-powered devices

#### Adaptive Routing Policy
```cpp
auto policy = std::make_shared<AdaptiveRoutingPolicy>();
router.SetRoutingPolicy(policy);
```
- Comprehensive scoring based on:
  - Model complexity and size
  - Quantization support
  - Dynamic shape handling
  - Resource availability
  - Historical performance

### 5. **A/B Testing Support**
```cpp
router.EnableABTesting(
    "new_algorithm_v2",
    control_policy,
    treatment_policy,
    0.1f  // 10% get treatment
);
```
- Compare routing algorithms in production
- Gradual rollout of new policies
- Consistent assignment based on model hash

### 6. **Load Balancing**
- Monitors backend utilization in real-time
- Distributes load across available resources
- Prevents backend overload
- Supports fallback mechanisms

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ModelRouter**: Main routing engine (singleton)
2. **ModelCharacteristics**: Model properties and requirements
3. **RoutingContext**: Request-specific information and constraints
4. **BackendCapabilities**: Hardware capabilities and current state
5. **ModelProfile**: Performance history and predictions
6. **RoutingMetrics**: Monitoring and observability

### Routing Flow

```
1. Request arrives with model name and context
   ↓
2. Retrieve model characteristics and profile
   ↓
3. Query available backend capabilities
   ↓
4. Apply routing policy
   ↓
5. Return routing decision with confidence
   ↓
6. Execute on selected backend
   ↓
7. Record performance metrics
   ↓
8. Update model profile for future decisions
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup
```cpp
// Initialize router with available backends
auto& router = ModelRouter::GetInstance();
std::vector<std::string> backends = {"cpu", "gpu", "neural_engine", "metal_mps"};
router.Initialize(backends);

// Register a model
ModelCharacteristics resnet50;
resnet50.model_name = "resnet50";
resnet50.parameter_count = 25e6;
resnet50.supports_gpu_acceleration = true;
resnet50.supports_neural_engine = true;

router.RegisterModel("resnet50", resnet50);
```

### Making Routing Decisions
```cpp
// Create routing context
RoutingContext context;
context.batch_size = 8;
context.max_latency_ms = 50.0f;  // 50ms SLA
context.optimization_goal = RoutingContext::OptimizationGoal::MINIMIZE_LATENCY;

// Get routing decision
auto decision = router.RouteRequest("resnet50", context);

std::cout << "Selected backend: " << static_cast<int>(decision.primary_backend) << std::endl;
std::cout << "Expected latency: " << decision.expected_latency_ms << " ms" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Confidence: " << decision.confidence_score << std::endl;
```

### Recording Execution Results
```cpp
// After execution, record actual performance
router.RecordExecution(
    "resnet50",
    decision,
    actual_latency_ms,
    actual_memory_mb,
    actual_power_w
);
```

### Configuration Management
```cpp
// Using configuration builder
auto config = ModelRouterConfigBuilder()
    .SetDefaultPolicy("adaptive")
    .AddRoutingRule("resnet*", "throughput")
    .AddRoutingRule("bert_*", "latency")
    .AddRoutingRule("*_mobile", "power")
    .SetBackendWeight("neural_engine", 1.5f)
    .EnableProfiling(true)
    .Build();

config.ApplyToRouter(router);
```

### JSON Configuration
```json
{
  "default_policy": {
    "name": "adaptive",
    "parameters": {
      "complexity_weight": "0.3",
      "latency_weight": "0.4"
    }
  },
  "routing_rules": [
    {
      "model_name_pattern": "resnet*",
      "policy": {"name": "throughput"},
      "preferred_backends": ["gpu", "neural_engine"],
      "max_latency_ms": 50
    }
  ],
  "backend_weights": {
    "neural_engine": 1.5,
    "gpu": 1.2,
    "cpu": 0.8
  }
}
```

## Performance Metrics

std::cout << "Total requests: " << model_metrics.total_requests << std::endl;
std::cout << "GPU requests: " << model_metrics.backend_counts[GPU] << std::endl;
