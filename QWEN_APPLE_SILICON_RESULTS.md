## Problem Resolution

### **Previous Issues with Qwen3 235B**
The original 235B model was failing due to:
1. **Memory pressure** from massive model size
2. **Lack of proper Apple Silicon optimization**
3. **Inefficient device utilization**
4. **Quantization compatibility issues**

### **Our Solutions Implemented**
1. **Enhanced Configuration**:
   ```
   optimization { 
     execution_accelerators {
       cpu_execution_accelerator : [ 
         {
           name : "amx"
           parameters { key: "tile_size" value: "32" }
           parameters { key: "quantization_support" value: "int4" }
         }
       ],
       gpu_execution_accelerator : [ 
         {
           name : "mps"
           parameters { key: "precision" value: "fp16" }
           parameters { key: "use_unified_memory" value: "true" }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Smart Device Management**:
   - Automatic detection of AMX support (M1/M2/M3)
   - Fallback to optimized CPU when MPS unavailable
   - Proper memory pressure handling

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Real-time inference metrics
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Throughput measurement

- Memory consumption
- Device utilization

## Recommendations for Production

### **For Qwen3 235B Deployment**
1. **Use Quantization**: Enable INT4 quantization for memory efficiency
2. **Hybrid Execution**: Leverage both AMX and MPS for optimal performance
3. **Memory Management**: Implement proper cleanup and caching
4. **Monitoring**: Use built-in performance tracking

### **Configuration Template**
```python
# Apple Silicon optimized model configuration
optimization {
  execution_accelerators {
    cpu_execution_accelerator: [{
      name: "amx"
      parameters { key: "tile_size" value: "32" }
    }],
    gpu_execution_accelerator: [{
      name: "mps" 
      parameters { key: "use_unified_memory" value: "true" }
